# Mlops_Breast_Cancer_Fighter

This project objective is to find the person  is afftected by breast cancer (Maligant) or not affected (Benign)

The repository named mlops_breast_cancer_fighter due to the reason we tried to implement the mlops objective over to it

## The below pointers were tried respective to mlops.

1. we are building the report for feature engineering and model report where stated confusion matrix and accuracy loss (requesting here to add more details by my colloborator @Rushikesh Naik... )
2. Also this project will build the results as pie chart ,stating the percentage the given users are affected by breast cancer vs not affected

# Project Components 
- Below are the list of project components we are using. Components are nothing but the python files which act like helper codes to run our main file. Here my objective is to create a files which help us to train a model, save the model, and do the inference of the model. currently for the mlops I have not used any packages, I am mostly using python based standard packages. And after we explore what we can do with standard packages of python, I will try to create difference branches for different tools of mlops which are open source and don't required cloud. 

This project is purely for local setup, not CLOUD!, but the ideas of that which I will built here can be used in the cloud as well. 

# list of the components(File explainations) 
- main.py : as I am developing this file will act as Entry point of the project, From here we will trigger the training of model. But Before training we will require to do preprocessing, reading of the data, model setting and then comes the model fitting(which is training) will be triggered from this file.
    - As I am developing the project most of the work is done by this file.
    - For inference, (TO BE CONTINUE)
